# Sections, Paragraphs and Statements

The <topic>AR6 Syntheses Report</topic> consists of many sections, each of which has one or more
<topic>paragraphs</topic>. Each paragraph, in turn, contains one or more <topic>statements</topic>.

## Sections

We can list all the sections in the book:

<sparql>allSections</sparql>

Which gives:

<out limit="5">allSections</out>

Instead, we can also focus on paragraphs (also typed as section):

<sparql>sectionsWithStatements</sparql>

Which gives:

<out>sectionsWithStatements</out>
