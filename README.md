# Queries around the IPPC

This ebook has the purpose to summarize the semantic knownledge aggregated
in a custom Wikibase. If you want to contribute,
checkout the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

This repository is based on that of the [Wikidata Queries around the SARS-CoV-2 virus and pandemic](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/).

## Licenses

The content of the ebook is [CC-BY-SA 4.0 International](CCBYSA.md) but all SPARQL queries
have the more liberal [CCZero](CC0.md). There are a few helper scripts in the repository to
build the website from the sources and these are GPLv3.
